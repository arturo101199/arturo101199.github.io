									<h2>The Team</h2>
									<div class="theTeam">
										<p> This game was developed by an initial group of people that would later become WeDoGames. 
											The team consisted of 4 people, including myself. We were 3 programmers and 1 artist.

									<h2>The Project</h2>
									<p> The game is a collection of mini-games, where the goal is to complete as many as you can before losing 3 times. Each mini-game you win
										 gives you a score and speeds up the game a bit to increase the difficulty. There are 14 mini-games, and they are designed to be played only with the mouse.
									</p>
									<p> The length of the project was 3 months and was successfully completed.</p>
